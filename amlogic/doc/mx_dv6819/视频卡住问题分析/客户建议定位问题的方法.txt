It will concentrate on investigating cause of freezing issue in the system player with streams.

My suggestions for "discontinuously issue" testing. I use these cases for our player:

1) Setup unstable network Wi-Fi point with randomly bandwidth limitations. (i use wi-fi card + linux scripts)

 - It can force start Microsoft Smooth Streaming protocol bandwidth adaptation logic.
 - It can test player (source reader-> demuxer-> decoder -> render) fully cycle testing on stress situations.

2) Periodically disable/enable network by turn of Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable from board. 
(of cause short and long periods)

 - It can test audio + video chunks loading + buffering aborting.
 - It can test corrupted data in BufferQueue of player. (PTS / DTS corruption)
 - It can test player re-buffering after network problems.

3) Also seeking in VOD content with hot network operations can reproduce issue faster.

Please use these cases for reproduce problem. And issue randomization will be defeated.
